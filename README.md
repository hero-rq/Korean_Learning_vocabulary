Now, let’s get straight to the point. This image essentially captures the entirety of the app. It’s almost right to say that if you’ve seen this picture, you’ve seen the whole app.

In simple terms, this app provides English sentences in context, allowing users to practice or attempt output based on that context. When memorizing something, merely inputting information isn’t that effective. The key might be in the output as well. Attempting output significantly enhances memory retention.

Moreover, this is where the app’s greatest advantage comes into play: users can modify the Excel file as much as they want. You can edit the Excel file with the content you wish to memorize and practice output based on it. This is the core concept of the app.

Understanding the above information is sufficient to grasp the essence of the app, so I’ll skip over the further details. The core is enough, after all. Thank you.

Above all, I understand that sharing the app in this format is rather unfriendly, and I’m aware that anyone who reads this by chance is unlikely to use the app this way, haha. I’m not sure whether I’ll share more advanced versions of this app. If I feel like it and have the time, I might share more developed content. Thank you.
